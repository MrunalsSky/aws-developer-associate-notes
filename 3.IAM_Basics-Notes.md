### **Notes: IAM Basics**

#### **1. What is IAM and Why Do We Need It?**

- **What it is:** IAM stands for **Identity and Access Management**. Itâ€™s the AWS service that controls **who can do what** in your AWS account.
- **Main Goal:** To **stop using the Root User** for everyday work.
- **The Root User:** This is the super-powerful login you created with your email address. It can do _everything_ and cannot be restricted. Sharing it is very risky.
- **The Big Idea (Least Privilege):** With IAM, you follow the **Principle of Least Privilege**. This means you only give users the _exact permissions_ they need to do their job, and nothing more. This limits the damage an attacker can do if an account is compromised.

#### **2. The 3 Main Parts of IAM (The "Who")**

IAM lets you create three types of identities to grant permissions to.

1.  **IAM Users:**

    - **What it is:** An identity for a **single person** (like a developer named Bob) or a **single application** (like a backup script).
    - **Credentials:** Users have long-term credentials like a password (for the console) and access keys (for the CLI/SDK).

2.  **IAM Groups:**

    - **What it is:** A collection, or "folder," for IAM Users.
    - **How it works:** You attach permissions (policies) to the group, and all users in that group automatically get those same permissions.
    - **Why use it:** It makes managing permissions for teams (e.g., a "Developers" group, a "Finance" group) much easier.

3.  **IAM Roles:**
    - **What it is:** An identity with temporary permissions. A role is meant to be **assumed** (temporarily used) by a trusted entity.
    - **Credentials:** Roles do **not** have their own passwords or access keys. They provide temporary security credentials when assumed.
    - **When to use it (Very Important!):**
      - **For AWS Services:** An EC2 instance can assume a role to get permission to access an S3 bucket. This is the most secure method.
      - **For External Users:** To give users from another AWS account or from your company's login system (like Active Directory) temporary access to your account.

#### **3. How IAM Works: Authentication vs. Authorization**

IAM performs two main jobs to secure your account.

- **Authentication (Are you who you say you are?):**

  - This is the login step.
  - IAM checks your credentials (like your password or access keys) to verify it's really you.

- **Authorization (Are you allowed to do this?):**
  - After you are authenticated, IAM checks what you are _allowed_ to do.
  - This is controlled by **IAM Policies**. A policy is a document (written in JSON) that lists permissions.

#### **4. What are IAM Policies?**

- **Definition:** A policy is a document that defines permissions. It states what actions are **Allowed** or **Denied**.
- **Key Rule:** A policy does nothing on its own. It must be **attached** to a User, a Group, or a Role to have any effect.
- **Default Behavior:** By default, everything is **denied**. You must explicitly grant `Allow` permissions in a policy for an identity to do anything.

#### **5. Key Facts to Remember for the Exam**

- IAM is a **Global Service**. You don't choose a region for it. Users, Groups, and Roles are created globally.
- IAM is **free to use**.
- The **Account Root User** is the only identity that IAM cannot fully restrict.
- It's a security best practice to create an **IAM Admin User** for daily administrative tasks and lock away your Root User credentials.
