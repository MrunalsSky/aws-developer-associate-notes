### **Notes: Securing an AWS Account with IAM**

#### **1. The Goal: Stop Using the Root User!**

- This document is all about setting up your AWS account correctly so you don't have to use the super-powerful **Root User** for daily tasks.
- **Best Practice:** The Root User should be locked away and only used for specific account management tasks. For everything else, we will use an IAM User.

#### **2. Creating an IAM "Admin" User**

The goal is to create a new user inside IAM that has administrator permissions. This user will be our main account for working through the course.

**Steps to Create the IAM User:**

1.  **Go to IAM:** From the AWS Console, search for and navigate to the **IAM** service.
2.  **Create an Account Alias:**

    - This gives your account a friendly, easy-to-remember name for the login URL instead of just the long account number.
    - Find the **Account Alias** on the IAM dashboard and click "Create."
    - Choose a unique name (e.g., `training-aws-general`). This alias must be unique across all of AWS.

3.  **Add a New User:**

    - Go to the "Users" section on the left and click "**Add users**".
    - **User name:** `iamadmin`
    - **AWS credential type:** Check the box for "**Password - AWS Management Console access**". This allows the user to log in to the web console.
    - **Console password:** Select "**Custom password**" and enter a strong, unique password. Make sure you save this password!
    - **Password Reset:** Uncheck the box for "User must create a new password at next sign-in" to avoid having to change it immediately.

4.  **Set Permissions:**
    - Select "**Attach existing policies directly**".
    - In the list of policies, find and check the box for "**AdministratorAccess**". This is an AWS-managed policy that grants full administrative permissions (`Allow *` on `*` resources), effectively making this user an administrator.
    - Continue through the next steps (Tags can be skipped) and click "**Create user**".

#### **3. Logging In as the New IAM User**

- **The Custom Sign-in URL:** On the IAM dashboard, copy the "Sign-in URL for IAM users in this account." It will look something like `https://your-alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`. **Bookmark this URL!** This is how you will log in as an IAM user.
- **Sign out** of the Root User account.
- Go to the custom sign-in URL you just copied.
- The login screen will now ask for:
  - **Account alias** (should be pre-filled)
  - **IAM user name** (enter `iamadmin`)
  - **Password** (enter the password you created for the `iamadmin` user)
- You are now logged in as the `iamadmin` user, not the root user. You can confirm this by clicking the user/account menu in the top-right corner.

#### **4. Securing the New IAM Admin User with MFA**

Just like the root user, this new admin user is powerful and should also be protected with MFA.

- **Navigate to Security Credentials:** While logged in as `iamadmin`, click on the user menu in the top-right and select "**Security credentials**".
- **Assign MFA Device:** Find the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section and click "**Assign MFA device**".
- **Follow the Same Process:** The steps are identical to setting up MFA for the root user. You will need to scan a **new QR code** to create a **new, separate entry** in your authenticator app specifically for this `iamadmin` user.
- **Verify:** Enter two consecutive codes to complete the setup.

#### **Final State and Key Takeaways**

- You now have **two highly secured identities**:
  1.  The **Root User** (with MFA).
  2.  An **IAM Admin User** (also with MFA).
- **For all future work** in this account, you should log in using the **IAM Admin User** via the custom sign-in URL.
- This setup correctly follows AWS security best practices by limiting the use of the all-powerful root user and using a dedicated, MFA-protected IAM user for administrative tasks.
