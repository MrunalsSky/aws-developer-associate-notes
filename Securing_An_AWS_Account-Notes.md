#### **Notes: Securing the AWS Account Root User**

This document focuses on the most critical security step for any new AWS account: **enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the Account Root User.**

- **Who is the Root User?** The root user is the original identity created when an AWS account is opened. It is identified by the email address used for sign-up and has **unrestricted, full access** to all services and resources within the account, including billing information. It cannot be restricted by IAM policies.
- **Why Secure It First?** Because the root user is all-powerful, its compromise is the most damaging possible security event for an AWS account. The best practice is to enable MFA on the root user and then use it as little as possible, preferring to work with less-privileged IAM users for daily tasks.

#### **2. The Threat Model: Single-Factor Vulnerability**

- **The Default State:** Without MFA, access is controlled only by **Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)**â€”the root user's email and password.
- **The Attack Scenario:** An attacker ("the evil clown") could acquire these credentials through various means like social engineering, phishing, or a data breach on another website where the same password was used.
- **The Impact:** With just the username and password, the attacker can log in, impersonate the legitimate owner, delete all resources, steal sensitive data, or run expensive resources (like for crypto-mining) that lead to massive bills.

#### **3. The Solution: Implementing a Second Factor**

- **Adding the "Possession" Factor:** The demo illustrates adding a second factor: "something you **have**." This can be a physical hardware token or, as shown in the demo, a **virtual MFA device**.

- **How it Stops the Attack:** Even if the attacker has the correct username and password, they are stopped at the next login step, which asks for the rotating code. Since they do not possess the user's physical or virtual MFA device, they cannot provide the correct code and are denied access.

#### **4. Step-by-Step Demo Walkthrough in the AWS Console**

1.  **Navigate to Security Credentials:** From the AWS Console, the user clicks their account name in the top-right corner and selects "My Security Credentials." This takes them to the IAM console, but in the context of their own root user identity.

2.  **Activate MFA [03:38]:** Inside the "Your Security Credentials" page, there is an accordion section for "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)." The user expands this and clicks "Activate MFA."

3.  **Choose the MFA Device Type:** A dialog appears with three options:

    - **Virtual MFA device:** The focus of this demo. It uses an authenticator app.
    - **U2F security key:** A physical USB device (e.g., YubiKey).
    - **Other hardware MFA device:** Traditional code-generating key fobs.
      The demo proceeds with the "Virtual MFA device" option.

4.  **Set Up the Virtual MFA Device:**

    - AWS displays a screen with a **QR code**. This code contains the unique secret key for this MFA setup.
    - The user must scan this QR code with a compatible authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy). This action copies the secret key into the app, creating a new entry for the AWS root user.
    - The app immediately starts generating 6-digit, time-based codes.

5.  **Synchronization and Confirmation:**

    - To complete the setup, AWS needs to verify that the virtual device is working correctly.
    - The user must enter **two consecutive codes** from their authenticator app into the "MFA code 1" and "MFA code 2" fields. This requires waiting for the code to refresh at least once.
    - This step confirms that the time-based algorithm is synchronized between the user's device and AWS servers.

6.  **Success and Verification:**
    - Once the correct codes are entered, a success message appears. MFA is now active.
    - To test it, the user **signs out** and then attempts to **log back in**.
    - After entering the correct email and password, a new screen appears prompting for the "MFA code".
    - Entering the current code from the authenticator app grants access to the console, confirming that MFA is successfully protecting the account.
