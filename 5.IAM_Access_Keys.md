### **Notes: IAM Access Keys**

#### **1. What are IAM Access Keys?**

- **Purpose:** Access Keys are for **programmatic access** to AWS. This means using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), SDKs (Software Development Kits), or other applications to interact with AWS, rather than using the web console.
- **Credentials Type:** They are **long-term credentials** associated with an IAM User. Unlike temporary credentials from roles, they don't expire automatically.
- **Key Fact:** Only **IAM Users** can have access keys. IAM Roles do not; they use temporary credentials instead.

#### **2. The Two Parts of an Access Key**

An access key is not a single value; it's a pair of keys that must be used together.

1.  **Access Key ID:**

    - This is the **public** part of the key.
    - It's safe to share and is used to identify which IAM user is making the request.
    - Example format: `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`

2.  **Secret Access Key:**
    - This is the **private** and **confidential** part of the key.
    - **Treat it like a password!** It should never be shared or exposed publicly (e.g., committed to a Git repository).
    - **Crucial Rule:** The Secret Access Key is **only shown once** when you first create it. If you lose it, you cannot retrieve it. You must delete the old access key and create a new one.

#### **3. Managing Access Keys**

You have full lifecycle control over your access keys.

- **Maximum per User:** An IAM user can have a maximum of **two** active access keys at one time.
- **Why Two Keys?** This allows for **key rotation**. You can create a new key, update all your applications to use it, and then safely delete the old key without any downtime.
- **Lifecycle:** You can **create**, **delete**, make **inactive** (temporarily disable), and make **active** again.

#### **4. Best Practices for Access Keys**

- **Don't Use Root User Keys:** Never create access keys for your Account Root User. It's a major security risk.
- **Use IAM Roles Instead:** For applications running on AWS services (like EC2 or Lambda), always use **IAM Roles** to grant temporary permissions. This is more secure than storing long-term access keys on the instance.
- **Rotate Keys Regularly:** Periodically delete old keys and create new ones to limit the window of exposure if a key is ever compromised.
- **Never Hardcode Keys:** Do not embed access keys directly in your application code. Use environment variables, IAM roles, or other secure methods to provide credentials to your application.
